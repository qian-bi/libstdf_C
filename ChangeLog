0.7
	* correct implementation of VUR record
	* dump_records_to_ascii.c, stdf2xtdf.c -> print_Dn prints PMR_INDEX instead of bit field
	* updated examples

0.6	
	* Added support for stdf v4-2007
	* fixed GDR record
	* fix that bzip2 works with mingw64

0.5
	* Cleanup build system all over the place
	* Use explicit casts for enum conversions
	* Add an "stdf" prefix to all exported API pieces to play nice with other libraries
	* Remove all header pollution from autotools by internalizing them
	* Set initial state of records to parsed so people can do more direct manipulation
	* Initial support for PTR/FTR in STDFv3
	* STDF writing functions should be (in theory) complete

0.4
	* Initial partial support for writing STDF files
	* Add support for reading LZW compressed files (.Z)
	* Verify and fix MPR/FTR record reading (just PLR left to test)
	* Support for random memory debug packages
	* New example for translating files into a jpeg
	* Hide implementation details to improve ABI compat
	* Hide internal symbols on ELF systems to improve speed/size

0.3.1
	* Plug some memory leaks
	* Check for more headers (to cover platforms like Solaris)
	* Detect endian type by checking more define's

0.3
	* Add support for reading compressed files (zip/gzip/bzip2)
	* Add a makefile for building in win32
	* More documentation

0.2
	* Proper usage of autotools for portability
	* Shared + static library building
	* Microsoft Win32 workspace for generating a DLL
	* Record buffering so that the filesystem doesn't get thrashed and everything runs a lot faster
	* STDFv3 support
	* Tested the crazy data types xU1, xU2, and xR4 and the crazy GDR record
	* More example applications to help you debug your own code
	* Lots and lots of bugfixes!

0.1
	* Proof of concept (I'm not just all talk! :D)
