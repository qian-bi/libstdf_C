 - stop thrashing the file system so damned hard ... read in the STDF 
   in as chunks of XXX bytes and then have the dtc functions run off 
   that buffer in memory

 - add a win32 directory with a workspace so this will build in Visual 
   Studio ?  guess that means figuring out how to make a proper .dll 
   and making sure everything is portable as can be ...

 - test the variable sized data types ... i can generate fake STDF 
   files for the basic data types, but the descriptions aren't very 
   clear on the xU2, xCn, etc... types and the only way to *really* 
   test them would be if i had a real data file ... anyone willing to 
   donate one or two ? :)

- should stdfv3 even bother being supported ?
