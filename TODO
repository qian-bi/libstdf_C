polish writing support

publish a cleaned up spec file containing all the info i have for
STDFv[34] in html format and post to website

clean up the custom STDF files i wrote and post to website along with
the output generated when run through the example apps

read in data from the STDF files in larger chunks than just 1 record at 
a time ... since files can easily have 50000+ records, we could cut the 
# of filesystem reads down by more than a factor of 10 with buffers of 
512/1024/etc... bytes

STDF 'lint' remover to 'shrink' STDF files ...
 - check if PTR records repeat the entries for limits, test name, etc...
   If so, then remove duplicate entries after the first occurence

stop polluting exported name space with HAVE_* defines

figure out how to integrate tests/Makefile.in properly so i dont have
to keep tweaking it

handle the cases in the V3->V4 transition where fields changed *type*

optimize memory malloc/free ... every member of a record requires a
tiny malloc/free which should be coalesced (when possible) into a
single record-level malloc/free
