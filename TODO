0.2:

 - stop thrashing the file system so damned hard ... read in the STDF 
   in as chunks of XXX bytes and then have the dtc functions run off 
   that buffer in memory

 - add a win32 directory with a workspace so this will build in Visual 
   Studio ?  guess that means figuring out how to make a proper .dll 
   and making sure everything is portable as can be ...

 - test the variable sized data types ... i can generate fake STDF 
   files for the basic data types, but the descriptions aren't very 
   clear on the xU2, xCn, etc... types and the only way to *really* 
   test them would be if i had a real data file ... anyone willing to 
   donate one or two ? :)
   i guess these suck currently and just cause segfaults ... for now,
   do no real work except to move the data pointer ahead the correct
   number of bytes ... :(

 - STDFv3 as best as i can

0.3:

 - zip/gzip/bzip reading support so people don't have to unpack before
   sending the files through the library

unknown:

 - ATDF support

 - STDF writing support
